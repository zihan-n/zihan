<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Zihan</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->


<div class="hero-image">
<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->

<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>Hello everyone! I am currently double-majoring in Psychology and DNID. Within the realm of Psychology, I am fascinated by human emotions and behaviors. I am especially interested in Developmental Psychology, Social Psychology, and Cognitive Psychology. As for DNID, it provides me with the opportunity to manage my own projects, creating a platform for innovation and personal expression which I find incredibly interesting. One course that has particularly caught my attention in psychology is "Topics in Psychology: Stigma." This course has given me deeper insights into the complexities of social stigma, offering me a comprehensive understanding of its roots in human psychology and societal norms. On the DNID side, I am particularly interested in the course on Human-Centered Systems this semester. The course may aligns with my aspirations to become a User Experience Designer, offering me valuable perspectives on design thinking.  My goal is to combine what I'm learning in psychology and DNID to better understand people and make designs that are easy to use, thoughtful, and inclusive.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>In addition to a foundational understanding of psychological principles applicable to design, such as the "Mere-Exposure Effect" and "Miller's Law," I also have some basic experience with design software. And I am particularly interested in how to apply psychological theories to real-world design problems. I believe that doing so not only provides practical solutions but also contributes to making designs more human-centric and reasonable. So in this course, I aim to complete a project to gain hands-on design experience, as well as learn how to be a good storyteller to package and present my work effectively.

  <h2>Potential Project</h2>
      <h3>To be honest, I haven't confirmed a specific project idea yet, but I'm torn between two main interests. On one hand, I'm passionate about tackling the issue of stigmatization in psychology. Society has deeply-rooted views on how we perceive and treat people with mental health issues, and I'd like to address self-stigmatization or public stigmatization of mental health conditions. On the other hand, I'm a cat person, these furry friends bring people a lot of joy and comfort, so I'm also considering doing a project related to pets. Regardless of which route I take, I'll likely need to do some research to pin it down.</h3>

   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>After I complete my studies, I aspire to have a career that offers flexibility and freedom, which is why UX designer appeals to me.
